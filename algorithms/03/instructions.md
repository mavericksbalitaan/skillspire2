- Create a program that prints out all numbers from 10 to 1 in descending order. (This does not have to be in a function)

- Create a program that prints out all EVEN numbers from 10-1in descending order. HINT: Use modulus operator or have your for loop decrement by 2 (This does not have to be in a function)

- Create a function that accepts 2 numbers as parameters. Return the larger of the two numbers. For example if given 9 and 10 your function should return 10

- Create a program that calculates the sum off all of the numbers from 1 to 5. The final sum for this program should be 15.
