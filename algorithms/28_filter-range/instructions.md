Array: Filter Range.
Given arr and values min and max, retain only the array values between min and max indexes.
Given [1,2,3,4,5],2,4 return [3,4,5]. No built-in array functions.
This does not have to be done in place meaning you don't have to return the same array that was passed in as a parameter.
