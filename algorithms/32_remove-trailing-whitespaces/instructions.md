Create a standalone function that accepts an input string,removes leading and trailing white spaces (at beginning and end only) from the string and capitalizes the first letter of every word, and return that string.
Given "      whitspaces are cool      " return “Whitespaces Are Cool”.
Remember don’t use any built in methods to complete this task except any methods that capitalize a character.
