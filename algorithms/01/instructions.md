1. Create a function that accepts 2 parameters x and y. This function should print out the product of both numbers (x \* y), the quotient of both numbers (x/y), the sum of both numbers (x + y), and the difference of both numbers (x-y.

2. Create a function that accepts a number parameter and returns the sum of all of the numbers from 0 to that number. For example if given 5 return ( 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5) or 15.
