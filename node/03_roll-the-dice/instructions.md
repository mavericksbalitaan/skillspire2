Roll the dice.

1. Prompt the user for a value between 1 and 6
2. Emulate a dice rolling session.
3. If the user rolls the number that they were prompted for then print "You have successfully rolled (number that they chose)"
4. You must also print out the number of tries that it took the user to roll that number.
