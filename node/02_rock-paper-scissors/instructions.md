Create a program that emulates a rock, paper scissors game.

1. Prompt the user for a number between 1 and 3 (1=Rock, 2=Paper, or 3=Scissors)
2. Use the random number generator to generate a random number between 1 and 3
3. Play the game! If the user chose a value that will beat the computer generated value then tell them that they have won. Other wise tell the user that they have lost
