Task: Develop a simple Todo List API using Express.js. Link a Mongo DB atlas database to your api.

Requirements:

1. Implement the following endpoints:
 - GET /todos: Retrieve a list of all todos.
 - GET /todos/:id: Retrieve details of a specific todo by ID.
 - POST /todos: Add a new todo to the list.
 - PUT /todos/:id: Update details of a todo by ID.
 - DELETE /todos/:id: Delete a todo by ID.
2. Store all of your data IN THE DATABASE.
3. Ensure that todos have properties such as title, description, and completion status.
4. Validate incoming data for POST and PUT requests to ensure required properties are present.
5. Test the API endpoints using tools like Postman or curl to ensure all endpoints work as expected.
