Routing practice:

1. Create a new Express project
2. Create a index file that contains all of the code to get your server up and running. In the index.js file create the following the routes:
3. / this will render a template that displays "INDEX" in h1 tags.
4. /display-name this will render your name in h1 tags
5. /display-food this will render your favorite food in h1 tags including an image of that food.
6. /display-vacation this will render your favorite vacation destination in h1 tags.
