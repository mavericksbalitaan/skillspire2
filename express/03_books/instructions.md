Task: Build a RESTful API using Express.js to manage a collection of books.

Requirements:

1. Implement the following endpoints:
 - GET /books: Retrieve a list of all books.
 - GET /books/:id: Retrieve details of a specific book by ID.
 - POST /books: Add a new book to the collection. (Use Post man to make this request)
 - PUT /books/:id: Update details of a book by ID. (Use Post Man to make this request)
 - DELETE /books/:id: Delete a book by ID.
2. Use in-memory storage (e.g., an array) to store book data.
3. Create a middleware to validate incoming data for POST and PUT requests.
