Task: Create a new React application using Create React App. Implement two React components: ParentComponent and ChildComponent.

1. ParentComponent: Implement a parent component that renders a <div> element with the text "Parent Component". Pass the following props to the ChildComponent: firstName, lastName, age.
2. ChildComponent: Implement a child component that receives props from the ParentComponent and renders them in a <p> element.

Submission Guidelines:

1. Set up a new React application using Create React App.
2. Create separate files named ParentComponent.jsx and ChildComponent.jsx in the src/components directory.
3. Define the ParentComponent and ChildComponent components in their respective files.
4. Use JSX syntax to define the UI components and render React elements within each component.
5. Ensure your React app runs without errors and displays both components correctly.
