Redirect to Profile after Login

Task: Create a new React application using Create React App. Implement a simple login form that redirects to a user profile page upon successful login.

Requirements:

1. Define two components: Login and UserProfile.
2. Use useState to manage form state in the Login component.
3. Use useNavigate from React Router v6 to navigate to the UserProfile upon successful login.
4. In the UserProfile, display a welcome message.

Submission Guidelines:

- Set up a new React application using Create React App.
- Create a new file named Login.jsx and UserProfile.jsx in the src/components directory.
- Define the Login component with a form containing an input field for the username and a submit button.
- Define the UserProfile component to display "Welcome, [username]!".
- Use the useNavigate hook in Login to redirect to UserProfile after the form submission.
- Test your React app to verify that the redirection works as expected upon login.
