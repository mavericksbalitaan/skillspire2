Routing practice:

1. Create a new React project
2. In your app.js create the following the routes:
3. /home this will render a component that displays "Home" in h1 tags.
4. /display-name this will render a component that displays your name in h1 tags
5. /display-food this will render a component that displays your favorite food in h1 tags including an image of that food.
6. /display-vacation this will render a component that displays your favorite vacation destination in h1 tags including an image of that destination.
