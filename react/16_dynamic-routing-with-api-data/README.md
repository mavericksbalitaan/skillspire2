Task:

Create a React application that dynamically generates routes based on hardcoded data and displays detailed information about each item using React Router.

Define the following routes:

- "/": This route should render a Home component displaying a list of hardcoded items.
- "/item/:id": This route should render a Detail component displaying detailed information about a specific item based on its ID.

Submission Guidelines:

1. Set up a new React application using Create React App.
2. Define a hardcoded array of items in the format { id: number, name: string, description: string }.
3. Use React Router to define routes dynamically based on the hardcoded data in the App.js file.
4. Create separate components for Home and Detail in the src/components directory.
5. Implement the logic and JSX for each component.
6. Test your React app to ensure routes are generated dynamically and display the correct data.
