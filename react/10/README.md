Task: Extend your existing React application to implement conditional rendering using React components.

1. Create a new React component called ConditionalRenderer.
2. Implement a state variable called isVisible and initialize it to true.
3. Render a <div> element with the text "Component is Visible" if isVisible is true.
4. Render a <div> element with the text "Component is Hidden" if isVisible is false.
5. Implement a button that toggles the visibility of the component when clicked.
6. Test your React app to verify that the component visibility toggles correctly.

Submission Guidelines:

1. Extend your existing React application from Part 1 to include the ConditionalRenderer component.
2. Create a new file named ConditionalRenderer.js in the src/components directory.
3. Define the ConditionalRenderer component in the ConditionalRenderer.js file.
4. Implement the logic for conditional rendering based on the state variable isVisible.
5. Ensure your React app runs without errors and displays the ConditionalRenderer component correctly with the appropriate visibility.
