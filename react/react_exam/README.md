React Assessment: Building Dynamic User Interfaces

Part 1: Component Composition: Multiple Components in One

Task 1: Create a Component Composition

Create a React component called UserProfile that represents a user profile. This component should consist of smaller components such as UserProfileHeader, UserProfileInfo, and UserProfilePosts.

Submission Guidelines:

1. Set up a new React application using Create React App.
2. Create separate files for each component (UserProfile.js, UserProfileHeader.js, UserProfileInfo.js, UserProfilePosts.js).
3. Define each component in its respective file and implement the necessary JSX to compose the UserProfile component.
4. Ensure your React app runs without errors and displays the UserProfile component correctly.

Part 2: Props - Receiving Data in a Component

Task 2: Pass Data Through Props

Extend the UserProfile component created in Task 1 to receive user data as props. The UserProfileInfo component should display the user's name, bio, and avatar image.

Submission Guidelines:

1. Modify the UserProfileInfo component to receive user data as props (name, bio, avatarUrl).
2. Pass the user data as props from the UserProfile component to the UserProfileInfo component.
3. Ensure your React app runs without errors and displays the user data correctly in the UserProfileInfo component.

Part 3: State and Lifecycle Methods

Task 3: Implement State and Lifecycle Methods

Create a React component called Counter that implements state to manage a counter value. The component should include lifecycle methods to log messages when it mounts, updates, and unmounts.

Submission Guidelines:

1. Create a new file named Counter.js in the src/components directory.
2. Define the Counter component in the Counter.js file and implement state to manage the counter value.
3. Implement lifecycle methods (componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, componentWillUnmount) to log messages when the component mounts, updates, and unmounts.
4. Ensure your React app runs without errors and logs the lifecycle method messages correctly.
5. Part 4: Event Handling

Task 4: Handle Events in React

Create a React component called ToggleSwitch that displays a toggle switch. Implement event handling to toggle the switch's state when clicked.

Submission Guidelines:

1. Create a new file named ToggleSwitch.js in the src/components directory.
2. Define the ToggleSwitch component in the ToggleSwitch.js file and implement state to manage the switch's state (on or off).
3. Implement event handling to toggle the switch's state when clicked.
4. Ensure your React app runs without errors and toggles the switch's state correctly when clicked.

Part 5: Lists and Conditional Rendering

Task 5: Render Lists and Implement Conditional Rendering

Create a React component called TodoList that displays a list of todo items. Implement conditional rendering to display a message when the todo list is empty.

Submission Guidelines:

1. Create a new file named TodoList.js in the src/components directory.
2. Define the TodoList component in the TodoList.js file and implement state to manage the list of todo items.
3. Render the list of todo items and implement conditional rendering to display a message when the list is empty.
4. Ensure your React app runs without errors and displays the todo list and message correctly.

Part 6: CSS and Styling

Task 6: Apply Styling Using CSS Modules

Apply styling to the TodoList component using CSS Modules. Style the todo items, input field, and button to create a visually appealing todo list.

Submission Guidelines:

1. Create a CSS module file named TodoList.module.css in the src/components directory.
2. Define CSS rules to style the todo items, input field, and button within the TodoList.module.css file.
3. Import the CSS module and apply the styles to the TodoList component.
4. Ensure your React app runs without errors and applies the styles correctly to the todo list components.
