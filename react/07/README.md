Task: Extend the Counter component created in Assignment6 to include lifecycle methods and demonstrate state changes.

1. Implement the componentDidMount() lifecycle method to log a message when the Counter component mounts.
2. Implement the componentWillUnmount() lifecycle method to log a message when the Counter component unmounts.
3. Modify the Increment and Decrement buttons to change the count state using this.setState().

Submission Guidelines:

1. Extend the existing Counter.jsx file to include lifecycle methods.
2. Implement componentDidMount() and componentWillUnmount() methods to log messages.
3. Update event handlers for Increment and Decrement buttons to change state.
4. Ensure your React app runs without errors and displays the updated Counter component correctly.
