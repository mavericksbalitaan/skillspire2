Create a simple React application that demonstrates Redux state management for a counter.

1. Set up a new React application using Create React App.
2. Install Redux and React Redux dependencies.
3. Create a Redux store with a counter state initialized to 0.
4. Implement actions to increment, decrement, and reset the counter.
5. Create a React component called Counter to display the counter value and buttons to increment, decrement, and reset the counter.
6. Connect the Counter component to the Redux store using React Redux.
7. Test your application to ensure that the counter updates correctly when the buttons are clicked.

Submission Guidelines:

- Ensure your React application runs without errors and displays the counter component correctly.
- Organize your code with separate files for actions, reducers, and the main application component.
- Use Redux hooks or connect to connect the Counter component to the Redux store.
- Test your application thoroughly to ensure proper functionality.
